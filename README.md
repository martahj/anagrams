<h1>How to Use</h1>

<h3>1) Install node if you do not have it installed yet </h3>
<p>
In the command line, run 'node -v'. If it shows a version number, you have node installed. If not, follow
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">these instructions</a>
</p>

<h3>2) Clone this repo </h3>
<p>
Open your terminal. To the left, you should see your current location in your filesystem (eg 'Documents'). Navigate to 
where you want to keep this repo using the following commands:
<ul>
  <li>
    'cd ..' will take you up one level - for example, if you are in the folder Documents/Hello, running 'cd ..' will
    take you up to the the Documents/ folder
  </li>
  <li>
    'cd foldername' will take you down into a folder - for example, from Documents/ running 'cd Hello' will take you into
    Documents/Hello
  </li>
  <li>
    'ls' will show you all the folders and files inside your current folder.
  </li>
</ul>
Once you are in the folder you want, go to the main page on this repo. There should be a green button saying something
like 'Clone or download'. Click on that and copy the url it shows you.
<br><br>
Now go back to your command line and run 'git clone pastedurl' (pasting in the url instead of writing pastedurl).
Now if you look at the contents of your current folder (by running 'ls'), you should see your new repo!
</p>


<h3>3) Navigate into the cloned repo</h3>
<p>
In your terminal, run 'cd nameofnewrepo'
</p>

<h3>4) Install your dependencies</h3>
<p>
In the terminal, run 'npm install'
</p>

<h3>5) Run the program</h3>
<p>
In the terminal, run 'npm run anagrams'. Follow the instructions that appear in the command line.
